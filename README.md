# ðŸš€ Go Concurrent Primitives

This repository contains practical, hands-on examples demonstrating how to use Goâ€™s powerful concurrency primitives. From goroutines to mutexes, wait groups to semaphores â€” it's all here!

## ðŸ“¦ Contents

| Folder / File        | Description                                  |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `mutex/`             | Mutex and RWMutex examples to prevent races  |
| `waitgroup/`         | Coordinating goroutines using WaitGroups     |
| `semaphore/`         | Limiting concurrency with semaphores         |
| `channels/`          | Communicating between goroutines             |
| `once/`              | Ensuring one-time operations with sync.Once  |
| `atomic/`            | Using sync/atomic for low-level concurrency  |

> Each example is isolated and self-contained, making it easy to explore and test individually.
